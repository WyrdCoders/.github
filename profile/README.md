# WyrdCoders

> **Developer education through examples, templates, and patterns.**  
> A home for practical reference projects in .NET, Angular, and beyond.

## 🌟 Mission
WyrdCoders exists to make developer learning **practical and reusable**. Instead of abstract tutorials, we provide **real project examples** that demonstrate:
- Framework setup and structure
- Clean Architecture and design patterns
- Middleware registration order and configuration
- Common workflows and starter templates

Our goal is to help developers (including ourselves!) stay sharp, build faster, and share knowledge openly.

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here
Each repository under WyrdCoders focuses on a specific framework or concept:

- **dotnet-aspnet-examples**  
  Reference ASP.NET MVC projects showing Clean Architecture, middleware ordering, and project setup.

- **dotnet-blazor-examples**  
  Blazor starter apps with component patterns and hosting configurations.

- **angular-examples**  
  Angular projects demonstrating module organization, routing, and state management.

- **architecture-patterns** *(planned)*  
  Cross-cutting examples of Clean Architecture, CQRS, and testing strategies.
